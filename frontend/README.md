Rocket League Web application

This is a small, two page application that uses express js and MongoDB Atlas to
display statistics about the contenders in season 1 of the Rocket League
Championship Series. A home page displays the eight teams, and a link for each
team takes you to the team page, where their standing and players are listed,
along with a few stats about each player and team averages.

To run this application, first make sure that you have all the necessary 
dependencies using npm. Go to the root directory and type npm install -g.

Now go to the frontend directory, and type npm start to host the server on
http://127.0.0.1:3000/

Our database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas, and is hosted in the cloud.
